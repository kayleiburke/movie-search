Build a basic, functioning application that consumes the [OMDB api](https://www.omdbapi.com/). Specifically, it should do the following:
 
1. Allow a user to enter a search term
2. Execute a search on the [OMDB api](https://www.omdbapi.com/).
3. Get the results back, parse them and display them some way. 
4. Allow the user to select one of the results.
5. Make another call to the API to get details on that selection.
6. Parse and display the details.

## Demo Site
A live demo of the site can be found at https://omdb-database-search-demo.herokuapp.com/
