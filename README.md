# Overview
A Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to perform searches against the [OMDB api](https://www.omdbapi.com/).  OMDB is an open source movie database containing over 280,000 movies.  

## Project Specifications
This project was created as part of a job interview process. The specifications for this project were as follows:

> Build a basic, functioning application that consumes the [OMDB api](https://www.omdbapi.com/). Specifically, it should do the following:
> 
> 1. Allow a user to enter a search term
> 2. Execute a search on the [OMDB api](https://www.omdbapi.com/).
> 3. Get the results back, parse them and display them some way. 
> 4. Allow the user to select one of the results.
> 5. Make another call to the API to get details on that selection.
> 6. Parse and display the details.
